# Protogen's Number Game

> It's just a tiny CLI game written in ZIG.

This game is UNIX-only. I have no plans on making it cross-platform.

## roadmap

1. Cryptographically safe random generation
2. Input handling (parsing numbers)
3. Win conditions. Simple winning screen.
4. File handling (ascii-art, scores saving)
5. Welcome screen, main menu, difficulties.
6. Win screen.

## Be cool

Unlicensed - hack it, share it, whatever.
But please mention me (gasfurr) somewhere?
