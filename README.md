> It's just a tiny CLI game written in ZIG.

This game is UNIX-only. I have no plans on making it cross-platform. It is decorated and just cool.
I have plans on chromium gamemode, but working on different project for now.

## Be cool

Unlicensed - hack it, share it, whatever.
But please mention me (gasfurr) somewhere?
